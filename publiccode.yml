    shortDescription: Service template to trace the deployments of microservice on stages.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Deployment Log provides a centralized way to record and track deployments
      of components across different environments. Delivered as a Spring Boot–based 
      service library, it offers REST APIs to log deployment events, update their status, and
      query deployment history. Integrated with Confluence, it automatically generates
      documentation showing the current state of all environments, deployment histories,
      and detailed deployment records including version, commit references, and linked
      Jira issues. It supports direct integration into jEAP CI/CD Pipelines. The Deployment Log
      enables transparency and traceability while reducing manual documentation effort.
      A service instance can be created by depending on this template, then adding specific configuration.
    features:
      - Records deployments and environment states via REST API and pipeline integration
      - Generates Confluence documentation with histories and current environment status
      - Supports automated links to source code and changelog generation based on Jira issues linked in commit messages
